# AI-Minesweeper Companion
AI enhanced Minesweeper helper using Propositional Logic &amp; Knowledge Inference

## Description

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field.

This project includes an Artificial Intelligence companion! Using **Propositional Logic** and **Knowledge Inference**, the AI analyzes the board and checks whether a mine is located in the square. The more squares that are revealed, the better the AI becomes as they accumulated more and more knowledge with each move.

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
